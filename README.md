# CameraObscura üéûÔ∏è

A WIP Hex project for easy image transformations and uploads.
A lot of this code was ported from a [social network called Ciao](https://github.com/tfantina/ciao_phx) I made a few years back. As such this is very much a WIP.  

This project leverages tools such as Image, and the user's own S3 uploader  (ExAWS or other), and, eventually Oban. As such I'm not seeking to reinvent the wheel, rather I want to take a few existing wheels and and make a car. Everytime I have to handle user images there is the inevitible issue of users uploading  6000x6000 5 MB images. While LV uploads make handling images a breeze I haven't  found a good way to resize an image, create  additional variants, and upload everything to S3 in one fell swoop.  As such I generally end up writing somehting _like_ CameraObscra in every single project.

## How it Works

CameraObscura provides a series of behaviours for uploading images to a bucket, 
transforming those images with the `Image` library, and returning variants of the 
original image. You can think "Cloudinary in my Elixir app". This met the needs of my little social network where resizing images and cropping to specific aspect ratios was very important.

The best documentation is to look at the specific behaviours found in `Provider` and `ImageGenerators`.

`ImageGenerators` is an API for consuming raw data and returning it as either a single `Image` or a series of `ImageVariant`s.  Variants depend on how you use the behaviour.  Eg.

   ```
   @variants ["200x200", "500x500"]
   use CameraObscura.ImageGenerators, domain: "accounts", otp_app: :my_app, variants: @variants
   ```
In this case the original `Image` will be created with two variants (200x200 and 500x500). 
The domain is a way of organizing images for sending to a specific bucket or pattern matching 
on the result that CameraObscura returns. A lot more functionality is going to be added to 
this behavour (see the to do section below).


`Provider` is an API to communicate with your local file system or an S3 provider depending on how you implement these behaviours. For example you may have a `dev.exs` file with a `LocalProvider` which interfaces with your local system while `prod.exs` could utilize a `TigrisProvider` to send files to Tigris or any other S3 provider. This behavour will likely remain fairly small in scope and act, only as an intermediary between your project and an S3 provider.



Because this is very much a work in progress rather than installation instructions I am 
posting a to do list with goals for the project:


## To Do:

- [x] Migrate `Pipeline` module away from Ecto based transactions 
- [ ] Allow users to pass a specific worker module into the `Pipeline` module to run transforms with a job 
- [ ] Write a test suite - in progress
- [ ] Allow for variants other than size (B&W)
- [ ] Generate meta descriptions using Bumblebee?


Documentation can be generated with [ExDoc](https://github.com/elixir-lang/ex_doc)
and published on [HexDocs](https://hexdocs.pm). Once published, the docs can
